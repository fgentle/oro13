I'm a data scientist, machine learning engineer, and evangelist of Bayesian statistics.

Check out my [blog on DS and Bayesian inference for science and business](https://oro13.github.io/) (WIP).
#### Current Projects:

I'm compiling and creating learning resources for Bayesian data analysis and science, called the [Bayesian Mixtape](https://github.com/oro13/bayesian-mixtape)

I contribute to numerous opensource projects, including [Holo-REA](https://github.com/holo-rea/holo-rea) for a post-blockchain operations/accounting library.

#### Recent Projects

I've also contributed to a variety of ML prototypes including a [language learning app](https://github.com/oro13/language-app-ml), a [soil nutrition predictor](https://github.com/oro13/soil-health-prediction), [auction price predictions](https://github.com/oro13/a-bulldozer-named-desire/), [fradulent activity detection dashboard](https://github.com/oro13/fraud-detection), user specific content recommenders, NLP analysis, ecommerce, and so on.
